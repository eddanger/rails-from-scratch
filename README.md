# Rails from scratch

I haven't created a brand new rails application from scratch in quite a long
time. This is my attempt at creating a new rails app with the intention of
setting up a basic app with authentication, and trying out some new Rails
features.

## The beginning

Set up a new rails application with postgres and stimulus.js

    rails new rails-from-scratch --webpack=stimulus -T -d postgresql
